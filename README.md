# Network-Config-Templates
A repository of various config snippets

Most of these are based on labs I have completed, the snippets are **NOT** all complete (some might be) but provide a good basis to complete a task

So far i've added various snippets from Nokia routers (SR7750 and SR7250) and various cisco switches and routers

The Nokia configs are performed in the Classic CLI mode rather than MD-CLI

# Todo:
- Add GLBP
- Add VRRP
- Cisco routed interface config
- Cisco switch interface config
- Etherchannel / LAGG interfaces for Cisco
